# ðŸŒŒ NebulaIAC

**NebulaIAC** is a modular, reproducible, and automation-friendly Infrastructure as Code (IaC) framework designed for secure, cloud-portable, and scalable service deployments. It balances real-world practicality with enterprise-grade architectural vision.

This project was created to explore, refine, and demonstrate modern infrastructure automation principlesâ€”not to provide a turnkey product. It's a working prototype and a public-facing example of how structured infrastructure engineering can evolve toward robust, secure systems.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- **Showcase professional IaC techniques** using real-world tooling and automation workflows
- **Provide a working base** for deploying VMs, managing services, and orchestrating infrastructure securely and reproducibly
- **Enable modular service stacks** that can be reused, combined, or extended without bloating shared configuration
- **Illustrate a path** toward enterprise-ready, zero-trust-compliant infrastructure
- **Support learning and demonstration** for others interested in modern infrastructure practices

---

## ðŸ›  Features

- âœ… **Terraform/OpenTofu-powered infrastructure provisioning**
- âœ… **Ansible-driven configuration management and post-deployment automation**
- âœ… **Dynamic inventory generation** with host group definitions embedded in each stack
- âœ… **Location-aware scripting** for regenerating Ansible inventory from all infrastructure components
- âœ… **Stack-isolated IaC directories** to cleanly manage multi-service environments
- âœ… **Centralized Ansible directory** with reusable roles, SSH keys, and global variables
- âœ… Designed with flexibility for **airgapped**, **on-prem**, **cloud**, or **hybrid** lab environments

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Overview

```bash
nebula/
â”œâ”€â”€ ansible/              # Roles, inventory, config, vars, and SSH keys
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/       # Per-stack Terraform modules and host definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ packer/               # Image build templates (planned/optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/              # CLI wrappers for Terraform/Tofu and orchestration
â”œâ”€â”€ generate_inventory.py # Merges host YAMLs into Ansible inventory
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation (you're here!)
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

1. **Provision a stack:**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/manage.py <stack-name> apply
   ```

2. **Generate the central Ansible inventory:**
manage.py automatically executes this, but you can re-generate the ansible inventory at any time for any reason. 
   ```bash
   ./generate_inventory.py
   ```

3. **Run a playbook against provisioned hosts:**

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/inventory.yaml playbook.yaml
   ```

Stacks define their own host group and machine metadata under `infrastructure/<stack>/inventory-hosts.yaml`.

## ðŸ“Œ Limitations

- **This is a work in progress**: NebulaIAC is under iterative development and should be treated as a prototype or reference, not a mature platform.
- **Security is a priorityâ€”but not fully implemented**: While the structure anticipates hardened, compliant builds, current deployments do _not_ reflect zero-trust standards or production-grade security practices. For example:
  - Deployments do not yet include certificate and ssl/tls management
  - Hardened images are not yet built using Packer.
  - No integrated secrets manager (e.g., Vault, sops) is wired up.
  - No integrated enterprise services have been implemented yet (DNS, Identity Management, Log Aggregation/Analysis, service monitoring, etc.)
- **Not OpenNebula itself**: This project **uses** OpenNebula for VM orchestration, but is not affiliated with or contributing to OpenNebula core development.
- **Not a polished, maintained product**: NebulaIAC is not a formal project under active maintenance. Itâ€™s a personal, exploratory effort to build and demonstrate something useful and well-architected.
- **Linux-centric and expects operator experience**: Assumes familiarity with CLI tooling, Linux, Terraform/OpenTofu, and Ansible.

---

## ðŸ”’ Security Posture

NebulaIAC is built with a long-term vision of **zero-trust compliance**, but the current implementation should **not be considered secure by default**.

Planned or envisioned security features include:

- As-code security compliance (STIG, CIS, and other benchmarks)
- Hardened Packer-built VM images
- Pluggable secrets and identity management (Vault, OpenBao, etc.)
- HTTPS-enabled service endpoints
- Certificate-based trust and automated certificate management

This project represents the architectural groundwork, not the destination. Contributions or forks focused on building out these layers are welcome.
